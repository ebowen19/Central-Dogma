# Central-Dogma
- Takes in a codon string input file &amp; codon to amino acid conversion table as input and locates all of the genes, creating an output file with the corresponding proteins as a sequence of amino acids (uses amino acid letter shortcut)
- Download the **codon-table.txt** for the amino acid conversion table
- **SARS-N.fa.txt** is an example codon string input file. It contains the nucleotide sequence for the SARS covid virus.
- Once you downloaded all the files and are in the directory with them, type **python3 CentralDogma.py codon-table.txt input_file2.txt** in terminal to run the program
